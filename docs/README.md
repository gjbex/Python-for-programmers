Python is widely used in many contexts.
This training introduces you to Python as a language suitable for
scientific computing and data analysis.  This training is intended for
those who have programming experience in another language, but are new
to Python.

In this training you will learn how to write idiomatic Python code, and
follow up trainings on using Python for scientific computing and data
analysis are available.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will be able to

  * read and understand well-written Python code;
  * write intermediate-level Python programs;
  * have a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the more
    sophisticated aspects of Python by practicing.
  * know about best practices and pitfalls for Python programmers;
  * have a working knowledge of the Python Standard Library;

## Training materials

Slides are available in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Python-for-programmers). as well as
example code and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use Python as a programming
language.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in another programming language,
This is not a training that starts from scratch.

If you plan to do Python programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.
