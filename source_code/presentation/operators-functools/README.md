OperatorsFunctools
==================

Python has a number of packages that are useful for functional style
programming, some of these are illustrated here.

What is it?
-----------
1. `sort.py`: illustrates sorting a list of nested tuples using a lambda
    function, and `operator`'s `itemgetter` higher order function.
1. `reduce.py`: illustrates `functools`'s `reduce` function by computing
    the factorial function.
