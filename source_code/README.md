# # Source code

Code samples for in the presentation, or provided as extra material, illustrating
certain subtle points.

## What is it?

1. `coins.ipynb`: change a sum of money into coinage, comparing a brute force
   approach to recursion, memoization and dynamic programming.
1. `condorcet_voting.ipynb`: implementation of Condorcet voting.
1. `counterintuiive.ipynb`: some example of counter-intuitive performance results.
1. `dHondt_method.ipynb`: assigning seats in gremia according to the number of votes.
1. `dice.ipynb`: modelling throwing two dice and visualizng the results.
1. `dynamic_programming.ipynb`: some illustrations of using memoization and
   dynamic programming to efficiently solve mathematical problems.
1. `generations.ipynb`: searching for the most recent common ancestor and the
  identical ancestor generation.
1. `hundred_prisoners.ipynb`: implementation of the solution to the "hundred
   prisoners` puzzle.
1. `islands.ipynb`: identify "islands" in a 2D sea.
1. `josephus.ipynb`: solving the Josephus problem; various implementations are
   compared for performance.
1. `kaprekar.ipynb`: compute the Kaprekar number.
1. `neighborhoods.ipynb` and '`game.png`: computing the hairiness of neighborhoods.
1. `one_liners.ipynb`: implementatin of a variety of problems as Python one-liners;
   this is for sport, not production.
1. `survival.ipynb`: study populatoin sizes in terms of procreation rates.
1. `structural_pattern_matching.ipynb`: example of structural pattern matching
   (requires Python 3.10+).
1. `welford_algorithm.ipynb`: implementation of WellFord's algorithm to compute an
   estimate for the standard deviation of a data stream.
1. `word_chains.ipynb`: create word chains out of a list of words so that the first
   letter of a word is the same as the last letter of the previous.  Search for the
   longest chain.
1. `knights_tour.ipynb`: example of using backtracking to solve the knight's tour
   problem.
1. `flatten.ipynb`: `itertools.chain` may not flatten a data structure as you might
   expect or want.
1. `matrix_rotation.ipynb`: rotate a matrix over 90 degrees.
1. `ocean_view.ipynb`: compute which buildings have an ocean view.
1. `cookie_monster.ipynb`: find the slowest eating rate for the cookie monster.
1. `compute_pi.ipynb`: compute the value of pi, taking into account round-off
   errors.
1. `iterative_binary_trees.ipynb`: using iteration rather than recursion to traverse
   binary trees.
1. `quad_tree.ipynb`: implementation of a quad tree and comparison to naive
   approach.
1. `cycles.ipynb`: find cycles in periodic functions.  Naive vs. approach using
   dictionaries, vs. Floyd's algorithm.
1. `ocean_view.ipynb`: compute which buildings have an ocean view.
