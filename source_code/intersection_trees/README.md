# Intersection trees

This project illustrates that implementation details, but mostly algorithmic
choices, can have an impact on performance when performing intersection queries
on intervals.


## What is it?

1. `intersection_trees.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating the different
   implementations and their performance.
1. `naive_pythonic_intersectionic_queries.py`: brute force implementaion that
   uses sets and named tuples.
1. `naive_intersectionic_queries.py`: brute force implementaion that
   uses lists and tuples.
1. `interval_tree.py`: implementation of an interval tree.
